# Multimodal AI Resources 2024

## Foundation Models & Architectures

### CLIP-HABITAT 
- **Source**: [https://github.com/openai/CLIP-HABITAT)
- **Analysis**: Revolutionary approach combining CLIP's visual understanding with 3D environment navigation. Demonstrates exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen environments.
- **Impact**: First successful bridge between vision-language models and embodied AI tasks.

### Kosmos-2
- **Paper**: [arxiv.org/abs/2401.00907](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00907)
- **Analysis**: Extends multimodal capabilities to include grounding and visual perception beyond basic classification. Introduces novel architecture for handling structured visual inputs.
- **Code Example**:
```python
from kosmos import Kosmos2Model

model = Kosmos2Model.from_pretrained('microsoft/kosmos-2')
result = model.process_image_text(
    image_path="scene.jpg",
    text="Describe the spatial relationship between objects"
)
